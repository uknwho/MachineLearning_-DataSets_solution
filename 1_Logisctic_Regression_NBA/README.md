This is a Data Set to practice calssification with logistic regression.

Logistic Regression is calssifier model based on linear Regression. The Response variable can be BInary class or multi classs with cateorical or numericals classes. It is simple to implement and provides probabilities for each class. The data set needs to be reqularised since high magnitude variabels might ifluence the predictions since its based on Linear regression. Logistoc Regression is highly effected by outliers. This model assumes attributes to be independent, so collinearity should be avoided.
